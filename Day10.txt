1. Number Categorizer 
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 100. 
If the number is less than 50, print "The number is small." 
If the number is between 50 and 75 (inclusive), print "The number is medium." 
If the number is greater than 75, print "The number is large." 
If the input is not a valid number or not in the range 1 to 100, print "Invalid input." 
After printing the message, ask the user if they want to input another number. If yes, repeat the process; if no, end the program with a message "Thank you for using the program." 
Ensure that the program continues to prompt for new numbers until the user decides to stop. 
while (1):
    n = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    if n < 1 or n > 100:
        print('Invalid Input')
    elif n < 50:
        print('Number is small')
    elif n >= 50 and n <= 75:
        print('Number is medium')
    elif n > 75:
        print('Number is large')
    
    x = int(input('want to input another number? 0/1'))
    if x == 0:
        exit(0)
    

2. Even or Odd Checker 
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. 
Check if the number is even or odd. 
Print "The number is even" if the number is even, otherwise print "The number is odd." 
n = int(input('Enter a number: '))
if n%2 == 0:
print('The number is Even')
else:
print('The number is Odd')



3. Simple Calculator 
Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 
Prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (+, -, *, /). 
Perform the chosen operation and display the result. 
Handle division by zero errors with a suitable message. 
n1 = int(input('Enter number1: ')) 
n2 = int(input('Enter number2: ')) 
op = input('Enter operator: ')
if op == '+':
    print(n1+n2)
elif op == '-':
    print(n1-n2)
elif op == '*':
    print(n1*n2)
elif op == '/':
    if n2 == 0:
        print("division by zero error!")
    else:
        print(n1/n2)
        
else:
    print("invalid operator")


4. Number Guessing Game 
Write a program that randomly selects a number between 1 and 10. 
Prompt the user to guess the number. 
Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. 
Allow the user to guess again until they find the correct number. 
Print a congratulatory message when the correct number is guessed. 

from random import randint
num = randint(1,10)
 
guess = 0
while guess != num:
    guess = int(input("Enter a guess: "))
    if guess > num:
        print("Too High")
    elif guess < num:
        print("Too Low")
        
print("Congratulations! You guessed it correct")


5. Multiplication Table 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number. 
Generate and display the multiplication table for that number (from 1 to 10). 
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"the table of {n} is: ")
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i*n)


6. Factorial Calculator 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer. 
Calculate the factorial of the number (n!) using a loop. 
Display the result. 

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
fact = 1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    fact *= i
print(f"the factorial of {n} is:", fact)


7. Palindrome Checker 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word or phrase. 
Check if the entered text is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). 
Print "The text is a palindrome" or "The text is not a palindrome" based on the result. 

string = input("Enter a phrase: ")
n = len(string)
for i in range(n//2):
    if string[i] != string[n-i-1]:
        print("Text is NOT a Palindrome")
        exit(0)
print("Text is a Palindrome")



8. List Sum Calculator 
Write a program that initializes a list of numbers. 
Calculate and print the sum of all numbers in the list. 
Prompt the user to enter a number to add to the list. 
Update the list and print the new sum
nums = [4,3,5]
total = 0
for i in nums:
    total += i
print("Current list is:",nums)
print("Current sum is:",total)

new = int(input("Enter a new number: "))
nums.append(new)
total += new
print("New sum =",total)
